# IPL-Win-Probability-Predictor
This project is an IPL (Indian Premier League) win probability predictor that uses machine learning to predict the outcome of a cricket match based on various factors such as team performance, player statistics, and match conditions.

## Features  
*  The predictor uses a machine learning model trained on historical IPL match data to predict the outcome of a current match.
   The model considers various factors such as team , venue etc. to calculate the win probability for each team.  
*  The app provides an interactive interface where users can input match details such as teams playing, venue, and current match situation (e.g., current score, wickets fallen) to get real-time win probability predictions.  
* In addition to win probability predictions, the predictor also provides insights into the key factors influencing the prediction.
   It can highlight which players or conditions are likely to have the most impact on the outcome of the match, helping fans and analysts understand the game better.
